Skills/Functions/Concepts Learned in this journey:
-zip()
-.join()
-string concatenation
-import queue (q.get(), q.put())
-from Collections import dequeue (q.popleft(), q.popright())
-recursion with trees (self.left, self.right)
-objects in Python are pass-by-object-reference (mutable objects will be modified (ex: lists, etc) but non-mutable objects (ex: integers, strings, etc) will not be modified), passing a mutable object to a function in Python is conceptually similar to passing an object by reference in C++
-linked lists in Python, range() function with additional parameters (range(len(myList) - 1, 0, -1)) starts at end of list and iterates one backwards each iteration, stopping at 0
-How to declare and define dictionaries (maps)
-You cannot explicitly define Python class methods as private, but you can utilize the naming convention to specify that a method should not be used outisde of the class (__function_name)
-Iterative DP problem using Dict
