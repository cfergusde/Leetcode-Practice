Skills/Functions/Concepts Learned in this journey:
-zip()
-.join()
-string concatenation
-import queue (q.get(), q.put())
-from Collections import dequeue (q.popleft(), q.popright())
-recursion with trees (self.left, self.right)
-objects in Python are pass-by-object-reference (mutable objects will be modified (ex: lists, etc) but non-mutable objects (ex: integers, strings, etc) will not be modified), passing a mutable object to a function in Python is conceptually similar to passing an object by reference in C++
